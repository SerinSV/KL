Beneath a sky of endless blue,
Where dreams and hopes are born anew,
A poet finds their voice, profound,
In whispers of the world around.
Through forests deep and meadows fair,
The poet wanders, soul laid bare.
Gathering fragments of nature's art,
They paint with words, a work of heart.
In the gentle rustle of autumn leaves,
Or the symphony of summer eves,
The poet finds inspiration's call,
In every sight, big or small.
With pen in hand and thoughts alight,
They shape emotions, day and night.
Verses dance upon the page,
Weaving tales of love and rage.
In words, they find solace and release,
Their heart's turmoil finds inner peace.
For in poetry's embrace, they're free,
To express what words alone can't be.
So let their verses fill the air,
A tapestry of beauty, rare and fair.
In each poem, a piece of their soul,
A testament to the stories they unfold.
